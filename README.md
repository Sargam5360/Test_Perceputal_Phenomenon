Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations. 
A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows you to relate to the 
conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

**What will I Learn?**

This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

How to identify components of an experiment

How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample

How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results

**Why is this Important to my Career?**

Using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of a Data Analyst's work. 
A strong grasp of statistics will also be necessary in the rest of the Nanodegree program.
